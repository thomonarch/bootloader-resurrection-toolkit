# Bootloader Resurrection Toolkit

This project is a collection of notes, fixes, and recovery steps based on a real situation where my Windows bootloader and shutdown process broke after removing Linux.

## Purpose

This repo exists to help anyone who ends up in the same mess I did. The goal is to build a simple, practical toolkit for fixing broken EFI partitions, BCD issues, and shutdown loops on Windows.
